1. the cluster doesn't have BC installed ?
	negative
2. the ${!tmp} stuff(line 307 & 310) ios wrong ? 
	negative
3. error message indicates protential problem at "sortIndex(416)"( sort function buged out again!? )
	sort function seems ok, it's the index overwhelm problem( due to wrong setting of EXTRACTN )
4. all class turblances have been recorded, but sort input are all 0?
	most likely due to the wrong settings of VASTART and VAEND
5. why extracted 300+ rogue while totalN = 100 & extractN=1000?
	cause Bash seems take "sortIndex" as kind of Associative Array, so even index i < 0, sortIndex[i] still returns 0
6. still no output img from GNUPlot
